# Inventory Management System

This project is an Inventory Management System designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It provides a system for managing inventory items, which are stored in a CSV file.

## Features

### User Types

The system supports two types of users:

1. **Administrator**: The administrator can view users from the file and update the inventory. The inventory update includes viewing items in the inventory, adding items to the inventory, removing items from the inventory, loading items from the file, saving items in the inventory, and saving items in the file.

2. **Customer**: Customers can place orders, check their order details, and view items present in the inventory.

### User Authentication

The system provides a login/signup option for users. User data is properly read from and written into a `users.txt` file.
